This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in as needed. The quote form (`/api/quote`) and contact form (`/api/contact`) both work without any of these set — submissions are logged server-side instead of emailed, and each form still shows its success confirmation.

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | No | [Resend](https://resend.com) API key. Without it, submissions are only logged to the server console. |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | No | Verified "from" address for outgoing emails. Defaults to Resend's shared testing domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`). |
| `QUOTE_TO_EMAIL` | No | Overrides the "to" address for quote requests. Defaults to `CONTACT.email` in `src/lib/config.ts`. |
| `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` | No | Overrides the "to" address for general contact form messages. Defaults to `CONTACT.email` in `src/lib/config.ts`. |
